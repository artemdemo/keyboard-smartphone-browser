# Smartphone keyboard in the browser

Detecting opening and closing keyboard in smartphone browser

## Problem description

The main issue is that it is not enough to add listenner to focus and blur on input elements. For example android has button that will close keyboard and input field wouldn't lose it's focus, therefore the solution most be smarter.
In addition we can't use "showkeyboard" and "hidekeyboard", case in wouldn't work in regural browser
